Eleanor_NPC (Group/New portrait): Welcome, young witch. I am Eleanor, guardian of the ancient spells. 
Eleanor_NPC (Group/New portrait): I see you've come to learn the art of spellcasting. This path is not for the faint of heart, but with patience and practice, you will master it.
Eleanor_NPC (Group/New portrait): Our spells are woven with the power of Regular Expressions, or RegEx for short. They may seem complex at first, but I will guide you through the basics.
Eleanor_NPC (Group/New portrait): Regular Expressions are patterns used to match text. Think of them as the language of magic that lets us find and manipulate words and phrases in powerful ways. Let’s start with something simple.
Eleanor_NPC (Group/New portrait): Imagine we have the text "Hello, world!"
Eleanor_NPC: To cast our first spell and find the word "Hello," you use the pattern /Hello/. 
Eleanor_NPC: This pattern searches for the exact sequence of characters "Hello" in the text.
Eleanor_NPC: Now, let’s move on to something a bit more advanced. Suppose we have the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Eleanor_NPC: If you want to find all the words that start with the letter "b", you use a special character called a "wildcard." The pattern /\bb\w*/ will help us.
Eleanor_NPC: Here’s how it works...
Eleanor_NPC: \b asserts a word boundary, ensuring we start at the beginning of a word.
Eleanor_NPC: b matches the character "b".
Eleanor_NPC: \w* matches zero or more word characters following "b".
Eleanor_NPC: This pattern will match "brown" and "b" in "brown fox".
Eleanor_NPC: Next, let’s learn about groups and ranges. Suppose you want to find any word that starts with a vowel.
Eleanor_NPC: In a text like "An eager owl observed every event," we can use brackets to define a range. The pattern /\b[aeiou]\w*/ will do this.
Eleanor_NPC: This pattern breaks down as follows\:
Eleanor_NPC: \b asserts a word boundary.
Eleanor_NPC: [aeiou] matches any one of the vowels.
Eleanor_NPC: \w* matches zero or more word characters following the vowel.
Eleanor_NPC: Practice these basic patterns, and soon you'll be ready to craft more powerful spells. The forest is full of secrets and challenges. Are you ready to continue your journey and learn more advanced spellcasting?
